Data connectivity and retrieval

step 1
    model  ->  we should create a model with us, which is used to create instance for updating and retrieving
    main -> writing the query 
    connected to the service package

    service -> the implementation of the query is done
            ->  we have to config the DB and collection(implementation done in config)
    
    config -> the implementation for configuring the DB and collection were done
           -> it will return the db and collection reference
           -> for configuring, we need the connectionstring(URI)
    
    costant -> connectionstring is declared
