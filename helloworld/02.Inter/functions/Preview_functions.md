Functions 
    -> functions in go have multiple return values those may be of different types or same types



FUNCTION OVERLOADING (ALTERNATIVES)

Go doesn’t support method/function overloading.
We can workaround Method/Function overloading in GO using,

1. Different number of parameters but of the same type
    Variadic Function – A Variadic Function is a function that accepts a variable number of arguments

2. Different number of parameters and of different types
    Empty Interface – It is an interface without any methods.
